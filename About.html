      <p> My name is Nima and I am a senior computer science major at Sacramento State University. My journey began 4 years ago as a biology major at San Jose State. After a few bio classes, I quickly learned that it was not the major for me, as I did not
        feel driven or engaged in any of my classes. I knew it was time for change, so I took a step back and went to community college, so that I could explore myself a bit more. <br /><br /> After taking a java course, I quickly felt more engaged and
        knew this was the right path for me, as I had a constant hunger to learn more. I decided to transfer to Sacramento state, as I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and move to a brand new place where I didn't know anyone, to reinvent myself.
        Moving to Sacramento has thus far been one of the best decisions of my life. I have found new peers and role models who push me to better myself everyday, and found joy in coding. <br /><br /> Now that I am close to graduation,
        I am looking for an internship to where I could offer a company my drive and passion in exchange for experience and knowledge.<br /></p>
